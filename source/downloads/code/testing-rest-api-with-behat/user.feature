	Feature: Testing the RESTfulness of the Index controller
    Let's see how RESTish this is

    Scenario: Creating a new User
        Given that I want to make a new "User"
        And that its "name" is "Chris"
        When I request "/user"
        Then the response is JSON
        And the response has a "userId" property
        And the type of the "userId" property is numeric
        Then the response status code should be 200

    Scenario: Finding a User
        Given that I want to find a "User"
        And that its "name" is "Chris"
        When I request "/user"
        Then the "name" property equals "Chris"

    Scenario: Deleting a User
        Given that I want to delete a "User"
        And that its "name" is "Chris"
        When I request "/user"
        Then the "status" property equals "true"
